		\begin{quote}

			Partly due to its simplicity, PathORAM is the most practical ORAM scheme known-to-date under a small amount of client storage.
			We formally prove asymptotic bounds on PathORAM, and show that its performance is competitive with or asymptotically better than the best known construction (for a small amount of client storage), assuming reasonably large block sizes. 
			We also present simulation results that confirm our theoretic bounds.~\cite{Stefanov:2013:POE:2508859.2516660}

		\note{
			The conclusion given in the paper is very concise, so I have just copied it down from the paper.
			To iterate, PathORAM is simple, practical and requires small client storage.
			The paper proves asymptotic bounds and negligible probability of failure.
			Lastly, the practical evaluation of theoretical results is given.
