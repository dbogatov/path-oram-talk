		Table 2 from~\cite{Chang:2016:ORD:2994509.2994528}.
		Worst-case scenarios shown.

		\note{
			Chang and others published a great paper a year ago doing accurate comparison of known ORAM systems.
			They analyzed space and time complexity of the systems.
			The result is on the table.

			Computational overhead is a composite of communication, encryption/decryption and client running overheads.
			Communication overhead measures how much information is transmitted during a round of read and write.
			Server and client respectively show how much space is used by an ORAM on the server and on the client.

			I am not going to elaborate on all ORAMs, but it is clear that one of them wins in every category.
			This is why we have chosen it for our secure cloud.
